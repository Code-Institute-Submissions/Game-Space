## **Development Testing Phase**
During development phase, I was manually testing the site in two ways:-
    
1. Publishing the page via GitHub and sharing it with friends and family to test within a set controlled environment, and receive feedback on major and small changes that needed to be rectified.

1. Self testing to ensure that "I" as the creator know what to expect of the site.

### **Manual Testing Phase**
* During the testing phase , I used three different browsers to ensure consistency & cross-platform connectivity. The browsers used in the tests are:

  1. Chrome
  2. Opera GX
  3. Edge
  
* I have also asked a small group of people to test the site using Apple & Android products using safari. The users reported back with no issues with overall content but with minor styling amendmants or styling suggestions which will be implimented in the near future with further testing.

* Google Chrome:

* Solutions:

* Bugs: 
  * Gray Bordering issue of resullts page:
    * Due to the time-frame of the project and the submission deadline being a day before the submission date, the issue of the grey border appearing in the linear gradient on the results page of the quiz is left in place as it does not fully do any harm in any of the major coding components nor does it crash the whole site or affect the code in the background as it is a minor appearnce issue.
    
## **Post Development Testing Phase**
### **Validator Testing**

#### **HTML** - https://validator.w3.org/nu/

* 0 major errors, 12 warnings have been found mostly due to the lack of headings for the HTML file.

### **Lighthouse Scoring**

### **Testing Conditions:**
* I have ran tests for the quiz the on mobile and desktop and with different brand devices to see if there are any issues.
* I have asked a small group of people to run lighthouse tests from their own devices. all have no issues via deskstop only mobile is slightly underperforming at 86% 

#### **Desktop Version:**
* No issues with desktop lighthouse score all performing above 90%.

**Maintaining the score:**

#### **Mobile Version:**
* The only main issue withthe mobile scoring is that origanlly it scored 81.
* Due to it being a JPEG file or either a PNG file.
* But converting the JPEG file to a PNG file did help increase the score from 81 to 86. 
* But overall the quiz is fully fucntion with no issues except rendering and imagery.
